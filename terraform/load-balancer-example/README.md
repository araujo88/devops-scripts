# Load balancer example

In this example, we define a VPC with two subnets - one public subnet for the frontend instance and one private subnet for the backend instance(s). We also define separate security groups for the frontend and backend instances, with appropriate inbound and outbound rules.

We then provision two EC2 instances - one for the frontend and one for the backend - and configure them to serve HTTP traffic. We use remote-exec provisioners to run commands on the instances to install and configure the web server.

Finally, we create an Application Load Balancer, a target group for the backend instances, and a listener rule to forward traffic from the frontend to the backend. The load balancer is configured to use the public subnet associated with the frontend instance and the private subnet associated with the backend instance(s).

In this updated configuration, we create an `aws_launch_configuration` resource for the backend instances, specifying the AMI, instance type, security group, and user data script. We then create an `aws_autoscaling_group` resource, specifying the launch configuration, subnets, and target group for the backend instances. We also set `min_size` and `max_size` to control the number of instances in the group.

Finally, we create the frontend instance, load balancer, target group, and listener. The target group is updated to use the ARN of the target group associated with the autoscaling group.

This configuration will automatically launch and terminate backend instances as demand changes, helping to ensure that your application remains responsive and available even under varying levels of load.
